# Pixel Drawing App (2021)

This is an old simple application for pixel drawing of mine, slightly refactored recently :-) Pick the color and click on squares.

Try it here: https://vadimgierko.github.io/PixelDrawApp/

## Description

Pixel Drawing App allows you to create pictures by filling pixels (squares on the board below) with color.

All you need is to pick the color from  color picker and then click on any pixel on the board to fill it with the color.
If you want to color bigger area, click at any pixel and then drag the mouse while it is pressed above pixels you want to fill with color.

Enjoy!
