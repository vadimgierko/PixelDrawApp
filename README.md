This is a simple application for pixel drawing :-) Pick the color and click on squares.
Try it: https://vadimgierko.github.io/PixelDrawApp/

Pixel Drawing App allows you to create pictures by filling pixels (squares on the board below) with color.
All you need is to pick the color from  color picker and then click on any pixel on the board to fill it with the color.
If you want to color bigger area, click at any pixel and then drag the mouse while it is pressed above pixels you want to fill with color.

Enjoy!

Technologies used in the app:
- React,
- Bootstrap (pure)

PS. Want to save your pixel drawing? Take a screenshot! Maybe it's not the most ellegant way, but I'll post another version of this app written with using p5.js library and it would allow you to click on canvas and save a PNG file, so the quality and sizing will be awesome. Also I'm working on extra features for the app, so stay tuned!
